    "description": "The Aqua Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) MYD16A3GF Version 6.1 Evapotranspiration/Latent Heat Flux (ET/LE) product is a year-end gap-filled yearly composite dataset produced at 500 meter (m) pixel resolution. The improved algorithm is based on the logic of the Penman-Monteith equation, which includes inputs of daily meteorological reanalysis data along with MODIS remotely sensed data products such as vegetation property dynamics, albedo, and land cover. The MYD16A3GF will be generated at the end of each year when the entire yearly 8-day MYD15A2H is available. Hence, the gap-filled MYD16A3GF is the improved MYD16, which has cleaned the poor-quality inputs from 8-day Leaf Area Index and Fraction Photosynthetically Active Radiation (LAI/FPAR) based on the Quality Control (QC) label for every pixel. If any LAI/FPAR pixel did not meet the quality screening criteria, its value is determined through linear interpolation. However, users cannot get MYD16A3GF in near-real time because it will be generated only at the end of a given year.Provided in the MYD16A3GF product are layers for composited ET, LE, Potential ET (PET), and Potential LE (PLE) along with a quality control layer. Two low resolution browse images, ET and LE, are also available for each MYD16A3GF granule. The pixel values for the two Evapotranspiration layers (ET and PET) are the sum for all days within the defined year, and the pixel values for the two Latent Heat layers (LE and PLE) are the average of all days within the defined year.",
