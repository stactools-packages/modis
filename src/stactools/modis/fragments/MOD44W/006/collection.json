    "description": "The Terra Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer\n(MODIS) Land Water Mask (MOD44W) Version 6 data product provides a global\nmap of surface water at 250 meter (m) spatial resolution. The data are\navailable annually from 2000 to 2015. MOD44W Version 6 is derived using a\ndecision tree classifier trained with MODIS data and validated with the\nVersion 5 MOD44W data product. A series of masks are applied to address\nknown issues caused by terrain shadow, burn scars, cloudiness, or ice cover\nin oceans. A primary improvement in Version 6 is the generation of time series\ndata rather than a simple static representation of water, given that water bodies\nfluctuate in size and location over time due to both natural and anthropogenic causes.\nProvided in each MOD44W Version 6 Hierarchical Data Format 4 (HDF4) file are layers\nfor land, water, no data, and an associated per pixel quality assurance (QA) layer\nthat provides users with information on the determination of water.",
