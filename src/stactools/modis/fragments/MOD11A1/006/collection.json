    "description": "The MOD11A1 Version 6 product provides daily per-pixel Land Surface\n                         Temperature and Emissivity (LST&E) with 1 kilometer (km) spatial\n                         resolution in a 1,200 by 1,200 km grid. The pixel temperature value is\n                         derived from the MOD11_L2 swath product. Above 30 degrees latitude, some\n                         pixels may have multiple observations where the criteria for clear-sky\n                         are met. When this occurs, the pixel value is a result of the average\n                         of all qualifying observations. Provided along with the daytime and\n                         nighttime surface temperature bands are associated quality control\n                         assessments, observation times, view zenith angles, and clear-sky coverages\n                         along with bands 31 and 32 emissivities from land cover types.",
