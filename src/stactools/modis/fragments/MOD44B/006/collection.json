    "description": "The MOD44B Version 6 Vegetation Continuous Fields\n(VCF) yearly product is a global representation of surface vegetation cover as\ngradations of three ground cover components: percent tree cover, percent non-tree\ncover, and percent non-vegetated (bare). VCF products provide a continuous,\nquantitative portrayal of land surface cover at 250 meter (m) pixel resolution,\nwith a sub-pixel depiction of percent cover in reference to the three ground cover\ncomponents. The sub-pixel mixture of ground cover estimates represents a revolutionary\napproach to the characterization of vegetative land cover that can be used to enhance\ninputs to environmental modeling and monitoring applications.\n\nThe MOD44B data product layers include percent tree cover, percent non-tree cover,\npercent non-vegetated, cloud cover, and quality indicators. The start date of the\nannual period for this product begins with day of year (DOY) 65 (March 5).",
