    "description": "The MOD15A2H Version 6 Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) combined Leaf Area\nIndex (LAI) and Fraction of Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FPAR) product is an 8-day\ncomposite dataset with 500 meter (m) pixel size. The algorithm chooses the \u201cbest\u201d pixel available\nfrom all the acquisitions of the Terra sensor from within the 8-day period.\n\nLAI is defined as the one-sided green leaf area per unit ground area in broadleaf canopies and\nas one-half the total needle surface area per unit ground area in coniferous canopies. FPAR is\ndefined as the fraction of incident photosynthetically active radiation, 400-700 nanometers (nm),\nabsorbed by the green elements of a vegetation canopy.\n\nScience Datasets (SDSs) in the Level 4 (L4) MOD15A2H product include LAI, FPAR, two quality layers,\nand standard deviation for LAI and FPAR. Two low resolution browse images, LAI and FPAR, are also\navailable for each MOD15A2H granule.",
