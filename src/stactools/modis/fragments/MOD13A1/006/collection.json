    "description": "The MOD13A1 Version 6 product provides Vegetation Index (VI) values at a per pixel basis\nat 500 meter (m) spatial resolution. There are two primary vegetation layers. The first\nis the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), which is referred to as the continuity\nindex to the existing National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration-Advanced Very High\nResolution Radiometer (NOAA-AVHRR) derived NDVI. The second vegetation layer is the Enhanced\nVegetation Index (EVI), which has improved sensitivity over high biomass regions. The algorithm\nfor this product chooses the best available pixel value from all the acquisitions from the 16\nday period. The criteria used is low clouds, low view angle, and the highest NDVI/EVI value.\n\nProvided along with the vegetation layers and two quality assurance (QA) layers are reflectance\nbands 1 (red), 2 (near-infrared), 3 (blue), and 7 (mid-infrared), as well as four observation\nlayers.",
