    "description": "The Aqua Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Land Surface Temperature/Emissivity Daily (MYD11A1) Version 6.1 product provides daily per-pixel Land Surface Temperature and Emissivity (LST&E) with 1 kilometer (km) spatial resolution in a 1,200 by 1,200 km grid. The pixel temperature value is derived from the MYD11_L2 swath product. Above 30 degrees latitude, some pixels may have multiple observations where the criteria for clear-sky are met. When this occurs, the pixel value is a result of the average of all qualifying observations. Provided along with the daytime and nighttime surface temperature bands are associated quality control assessments, observation times, view zenith angles, and clear-sky coverages along with bands 31 and 32 emissivities from land cover types.",
